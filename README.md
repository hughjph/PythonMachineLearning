# Python Machine Learning
Following the tutorial from python machine learning by Alex Campbell

If you are interested in trying this out for yourself, change the function of the model on line 39 [here](model-validation.py) <br>
Some of the functions require different arguments <br>
Here you can find a list of the functions with their arguments<br>
* LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', multi_class='ovr')
* LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()
* KNeighborsClassifier()
* DecisionTreeClassifier()
* GaussianNB()
* SVC(gamma='auto')

To better understand what is going on here, I would recommend reading his book
